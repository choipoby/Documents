overloaded Zookeeper
- zookeeper cluster => still having issue with zookeeper
zookeeper usage 
- kafka (67%)
	: offset/partition written in every 2 sec
	: saturating zookeeper
- storm runtime (33%)
	: heartbeat every 3 sec

additional issue
- no batching, implicit batching by 0mq
- lack of back pressure -> drops tuples unpredictably
