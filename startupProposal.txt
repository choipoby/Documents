What kind of business are we in?

Currently, I feel that we are in the business for educational content.
with 1. TTS feature for ease of use.
with 2. Wiki feature for dynamic content update.
with 3. Discussion feature for user involvement.

Then, are we fulfilling below two cretia that I think is crucial for any content business?

-----------

What is good service that provides any kind of content.

1. User want to spend time with my service so much, so even he/she is willing to pay if it is not free.
- I am not saying that we need to charge for the service. I am saying that, "contents are so good and service is easy to use, he/she really wants to spend time with the service however he/she is busy!"

2. Service should bring monetary compensation to whoever provide the content
- If not, who's gonna provide you best content? If there is no compensation for great content, your service will be full of trashes.

---------------



My simple categorization of content business
1. if ( content provider == business owner) ==> content creation business.
2. if ( content provider != business owner) ==> content service business.

yFunnel is at the border line between Content creation business and Content service business.

"We basically create a initial content, and asks the user to maintain the content"


=> requires enormous funding or people.
=> (tech) news business is easy to build, but other than that, generally, content creation business may be very difficult to build




=> this is where we were actually building.
